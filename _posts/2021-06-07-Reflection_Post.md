title: Project Reflection Post 
---

- Overall, what did you achieve in your project? 
- What are two aspects of your project that you are especially proud of? 
- What are two things you would suggest doing to further improve your project? (You are not responsible for doing those things.) 
- How does what you achieved compare to what you set out to do in your proposal? (if you didn't complete everything in your proposal, that's fine!)

> We actually achieved most of the things we had in mind — we implemented an update method for all three models, we had dropdown menus and sliders for adjusting parameters, and we had a time slider that can be incremented both automatically and manually. The only thing that we didn’t do and wish we could have done is to move our end product into a web application. Unfortunately we weren’t able to find a good way to transfer all of our widgets to a webapp, which is kind of a shame. 

- What are three things you learned from the experience of completing your project? Data analysis techniques? Python packages? Git + GitHub? Etc? 

> 1. Using Github - I actually never used Github for collaboration before, so this is definitely a new experience
> 2. Learning new packages - For our project, we used some packages that we had no previous exposure to (Bokeh & Ipywidgets). This whole experience really enhanced my self-learning capabilities.
> 3. Project management -  This is my first time creating a solid timeline and proposal before starting on the project. I learned how to break down a task into smaller components and allocate a reasonable time window to each component. 

- How will your experience completing this project will help you in your future studies or career? Please be as specific as possible. 

> To me, the most important skill I’ve learned which I think is absolutely essential is the project management skill. We start out with a very general objective, and from there we brainstorm about what components we need. Then for each component, we research what technical tools we need to make this happen. And finally we assemble everything back together into a complete piece. This ability to break down what we want into what we need is the most valuable thing I’ve learned from this project.
