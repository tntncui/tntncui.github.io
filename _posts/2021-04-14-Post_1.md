```python
#load necessary packages 
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import sqlite3 
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from plotly import express as px
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
```

### Building the Database 

First, we need to establish a new connection. If this is the first time that you access this connection, a database called temps.db would be created in current directory.


```python
conn = sqlite3.connect('temps.db') 
```


```python
def prepdata(df):
    '''
    prepares the temps data by stacking and extracting the month variable 
    '''
    df = df.set_index(keys = ['ID', 'Year'])
    df = df.stack()
    df = df.reset_index()
    df = df.rename(columns = {"level_2"  : "Month" , 0 : "Temp"})
    df["Month"] = df["Month"].str[5:].astype(int)
    df["Temp"]  = df["Temp"] / 100
    return df
```

There are three tables we'll load to this database: temperatures, stations, countries. The temperatures table is very large, so it may take a long time if we load it all at once. So instead, we'll load chunk by chunk. 


```python
#get the iterator 
df_iter = pd.read_csv('/Users/tianacui/Downloads/temps.csv', chunksize = 100000)
#load each chunk into the temperatures table 
for df in df_iter:
    df = prepdata(df) 
    df.to_sql('temperatures', conn, if_exists = 'append', index = False)
```

Next we'll load the stations and countries data. These two are relatively small, so we don't have to load them chunk by chunk as we did for the temperatures data.


```python
#load the stations data next 
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/noaa-ghcn/station-metadata.csv"
stations = pd.read_csv(url)
stations.to_sql('stations', conn, if_exists = 'replace', index = False)
```


```python
#load the countries data last  
url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mysociety/gaze/master/data/fips-10-4-to-iso-country-codes.csv'
countries = pd.read_csv(url)
countries.to_sql('countries', conn, if_exists = 'replace', index = False)
```

Remember to close the connection when you finish constructing the database! It could cause errors and crushes if you don't close it.


```python
#close the connection
conn.close()
```

### Write a Query Function

In this section, I will be showing you how to use SQL query to get the data we want from the database. The function I'll create is called query_climate_database(), which accepts four arguments:
- country, a string giving the name of a country for which data should be returned.
- year_begin and year_end, two integers giving the earliest and latest years for which should be returned.
- month, an integer giving the month of the year for which should be returned.

Its output is a dataframe consisted of seven columns:
- The station name.
- The latitude of the station.
- The longitude of the station.
- The name of the country in which the station is located.
- The year in which the reading was taken.
- The month in which the reading was taken.
- The average temperature at the specified station during the specified year and month.


```python
def query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month):
    conn = sqlite3.connect('temps.db')
    cmd = \
    f'''
    SELECT stations.name,
        stations.latitude,
        stations.longitude,
        countries.name AS country,
        temperatures.year,
        temperatures.month,
        temperatures.temp
    FROM temperatures
    LEFT JOIN stations on temperatures.id = stations.id
    LEFT JOIN countries on SUBSTR(temperatures.id, 1, 2) = countries.`FIPS 10-4`
    WHERE temperatures.year >= {year_begin} AND 
        temperatures.year <= {year_end} AND 
        temperatures.month = {month} AND 
        countries.name ="{country}"
    '''
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)
    conn.close()
    return df 
```

While this query may seem daunting at first, it's easy to parse through. The SELECT command allows us to choose the columns we want. The FROM command indicates which table we are getting the information from. In this case, the temperatures table is joined with the stations and countries table with the LEFT JOIN command. And finally, the WHERE command tells us which observations we want to include in our dataframe. 


```python
#a sample usage of the function 
df = query_climate_database(country = "India", year_begin = 1980, year_end = 2020, month = 1)
df.head()
```




### Visualization I: Temperature Change in relation to Geographical Information 

Now we are finally getting to the exciting part of the task, which is to create some cool visualizations. The first visualization would be addressing the following question: How does the average yearly change in temperature vary within a given country? There are three major steps we need to do here. 

1. We need to extract the requested data based on the given country, month, and time period. Fortunately, the query_climate_database function that we defined before will do most(but not all) work for us.
2. We need to calculate the estimated average yearly change in temperature. This can be done by computing the first coefficient of a linear regression model for each station.
3. We need to visualize the yearly change that we calculated in step 2, along with each station's geographical location. This can be done so using the plotly package. 

Before we start, here are some helper functions/dictionaries that will be extremely helpful for our main function. d is just a little dictionary that helps us "translate" numerical digit into the corresponding month. The coef function computes the first coefficient of a linear regression model for each station (needed for step 2 of our plan). 


```python
#a little dictionary that helps us "translate" the digit into the corresponding month
d = {
    1: 'January',
    2: 'February',
    3: 'March',
    4: 'April',
    5: 'May',
    6: 'June',
    7: 'July',
    8: 'August',
    9: 'September',
    10: 'October',
    11: 'November',
    12: 'December'
}


def coef(data_group):
    '''
    computes the first coefficient of a linear regression model for each station (needed for step 2 of our plan)
    '''
    x = data_group[["Year"]] # 2 brackets because X should be a df
    y = data_group["Temp"]   # 1 bracket because y should be a series
    LR = LinearRegression()
    LR.fit(x, y)
    return round(LR.coef_[0], 5) 
```

Now we have everything we need to get started! 


```python
def temperature_coefficient_plot(country, year_begin, year_end, month, min_obs, **kwargs):
    '''
    plots the average annual temperature change for the selected country, month, and period of time 
    '''
    df = query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month) #use the query_climate_database func to get the info we need
    df['obs'] = df.groupby(['NAME'])['Temp'].transform(len) #calculate the number of observations for each station 
    df = df[df['obs'] >= 8] #remove those that have fewer observations than min_obs
    coefs = df.groupby(["NAME", "LONGITUDE", "LATITUDE"]).apply(coef) #get the estimated annual temperature change using the coef func 
    coefs = coefs.reset_index()
    coefs = coefs.rename(columns = {0: 'Estimated Yearly Temperature Change (°C)'}) # rename the column 
    #plot the result
    return px.scatter_mapbox(coefs, 
                        lat = "LATITUDE",
                        lon = "LONGITUDE",
                        color = 'Estimated Yearly Temperature Change (°C)',
                        hover_name = "NAME", 
                        title = f'Estimated yearly temperature change (°C) in {d[month]}<br> for stations in {country} from {year_begin} to {year_end}',
                        **kwargs)
```


```python
#sample usage 
color_map = px.colors.diverging.RdGy_r # choose a colormap

fig = temperature_coefficient_plot("India", 1980, 2020, 1, 
                                   min_obs = 10,
                                   zoom = 2,
                                   mapbox_style="carto-positron",
                                   color_continuous_scale=color_map)
```

### Visualization II: General Trendline Over Selected Period of Time 

The next question that we may wanna ask is:
- How did the temperature change over a selected period of time for a group of selected countries?

To do so, we'll again start by creating a query function that allows us to get the data we need.

The function query2 takes three inputs:
- a list of countries that we want to examine (stored in a tuple)
- year_begin to indicate the start of the desired time period 
- year_end to indicate the end of the desired time period 
 
It returns a dataframe consisted of five columns:
- The name of the country 
- The year of which the data is collected 
- The month of which the data is collected
- The average temperature rounded to 3 decimal places
- The datetime consisted of year and month 


```python
def query2(list_of_countries, year_begin, year_end):
    conn = sqlite3.connect('temps.db')
    cmd = \
    f'''
    SELECT countries.name AS country,
        temperatures.year,
        temperatures.month,
        ROUND(AVG(temperatures.temp), 3) 
    FROM temperatures
    LEFT JOIN countries on SUBSTR(temperatures.id, 1, 2) = countries.`FIPS 10-4`
    WHERE temperatures.year >= {year_begin} AND 
        temperatures.year <= {year_end} AND 
        countries.name IN {list_of_countries}
    GROUP BY countries.name, temperatures.year, temperatures.month
    '''
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)
    df = df.rename(columns = {'ROUND(AVG(temperatures.temp), 3)': 'Average Temperature'}) #rename the column
    df['Time'] = df['Year'].astype(str) + '-' + df['Month'].astype(str) #create a datetime series out of year and month
    df['Time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Time'])
    conn.close()
    return df 
```

Now let's write the function that plots the trendline. Most of the work is already done by the query, so the remaining task is just to apply the plotly tools


```python
def trendline_plot(list_of_countries, year_begin, year_end, **kwargs):
    '''
    Plots the general trendline over a selected period of time for a selected group of countries 
    list of countries = countries that we want to examine (stored in a tuple)
    year_begin = the start of the desired time period 
    year_end = the end of the desired time period 
    '''
    df = query2(list_of_countries, year_begin, year_end)
    return px.line(data_frame = df, 
              x ='Time', 
              y = 'Average Temperature', 
              color = 'country', 
              hover_name='country', 
              title = f'Average Temperature from {year_begin} to {year_end}',
              **kwargs)
```


```python
import plotly.io as pio
pio.templates.default = "plotly_white" #sets a template 

list_of_countries = ('China', 'Japan', 'India') #plotting the trendline for three countries over the last 20 years 
year_begin = 2000
year_end = 2020
fig = trendline_plot(list_of_countries, year_begin, year_end)
```

### Visualization III: Choropleth of Global Average Temperature in A Selected Month 

The third question we want to answer is: 
- What is the average historical temperature for each country in a specified region in a specified month?

As usual, we are gonna start by creating a query function that allows us to grab the information we need.

The function query3 takes one input:
- month of which we want to examine 
 
It returns a dataframe consisted of three columns:
- The name of the country 
- The month of which the data is collected, which should be the same as the indicated month 
- The average temperature rounded to 3 decimal places


```python
def query3(month):
    conn = sqlite3.connect('temps.db')
    cmd = \
    f'''
    SELECT countries.name AS country,
        temperatures.month,
        ROUND(AVG(temperatures.temp), 3) 
    FROM temperatures
    LEFT JOIN countries on SUBSTR(temperatures.id, 1, 2) = countries.`FIPS 10-4`
    WHERE temperatures.month = {month}
    GROUP BY countries.name, temperatures.month
    '''
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)
    df = df.rename(columns = {'ROUND(AVG(temperatures.temp), 3)': 'Average Temperature'})
    conn.close()
    return df
```

You may wonder why we don't need the longitude and latitude in this case. This is because choropleth requires the longitude and latitude to be stored in a GeoJSON file. A GeoJSON file is a special kind of data file that's often used to store large metadata. So before we get into the actual visualization, let's import the GeoJSON file from the web.


```python
from urllib.request import urlopen
import json

countries_gj_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/countries.geojson"

with urlopen(countries_gj_url) as response:
    countries_gj = json.load(response)
```

Now let's write the function that actually plots the choropleth!


```python
def global_choropleth(month, **kwargs):
    '''
    Plots the choropleth for average historical global temperature for a selected month 
    '''
    df = query3(month)
    return px.choropleth(df, 
                    geojson=countries_gj,
                    locations = "country",
                    locationmode = "country names",
                    color = "Average Temperature",
                    title = f"Global Average Temperature in {d[month]}",
                    **kwargs)
```


```python
# sample usage 
fig = global_choropleth(3)
```
